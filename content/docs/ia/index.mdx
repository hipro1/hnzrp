## Welcome to the Internal Affairs Team

As Internal Affairs, professionalism, respect and integrity are of the essence. Ensuring our community is welcoming for new players, and that our rule violators get punished, plays a major part of your role. Just to recap some of the rules and standards that you will be held to and will judged based off your ability's to handle tickets, professionalism, activity, and teamwork.

## Tickets

Through your time of being Internal Affairs, we assure you, you will receive at least 5 report tickets. Here is just an f-a-q on how to handle tickets. You are not to talk in others tickets unless you get permission from whoever claimed the ticket to talk. You are also not to correct people in tickets, if you think someone had made a mistake, tell them in IA chat, not in the ticket. Review all the evidence in tickets and make sure that the ticket is valid and valid evidence, if it does not then DO NOT start a poll on it, simply tell them you don't have enough valid evidence to take action. Just some common sense, under any circumstances, DO NOT talk in a ticket that is against, or involves you, a management member will review it shortly.

## Professionalism

You are all Internal affairs members, you are meant to act professional in tickets and outside of tickets, your to have respect, and integrity for the team and community. You have the ability's to strike and punish people so you are required to be a example to people of how staff should act both while moderating and off duty as well. Punishments may come down harsher on you as your supposed to be setting and example.
