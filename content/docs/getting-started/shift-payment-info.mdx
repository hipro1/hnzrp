## Shift Guidelines

To go on 50/50 you have to ask for permission from Executive+ if there are more than 12 players.

If there are less than 12 players you may go on 50/50 (MGT+ this does not apply to you).

The amount of people on shift depends on how big the server is.

Generally, we use these numbers:

## Payment Guidelines

To get paid you **MUST** get 3 hours worth of shift time.

The minimum quota is 2 hours but to get paid you will have to achieve 3 hours worth of shift time.

You can only go on 50/50 for half of the required 3 hours to get paid.

Rest of the required 3 hour will have to be done on normal duty (sherriff team).

If you are going on duty you **MUST** click your shift type, failure to do so will result as it not being counted.
