| :h ‚ö†Ô∏è We are hiring staff, join our communications today! Code: hnzrp                                                                                                                             |
| :h üìå Please take notice: Failing to conduct Roleplay/reckless driving etc. Will result in moderators taking action!                                                                              |
| :h ‚≠êÔ∏è Woah! Would you like to join our communications server? Code: hnzrp                                                                                                                        |
| :h ‚ö†Ô∏è During the Priority Timer, avoid causing major roleplays that require a large police presence. Cop baiting will result in an instant ban with no appeal. Drive like you would in real life. |
| :h ‚ö†Ô∏è Please even out the roleplay teams. Otherwise, staff will hand-pick players to switch teams to ensure balance.                                                                              |
