## Shift Guidelines

To go on 50/50, you have to ask for permission from Executive+ if there are more than 12 players.

If there are less than 12 players, you may go on 50/50.

The amount of people on shift depends on how big the server is.

Generally, we use these numbers:

| Player count | People on shift |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| \<10         | 1               |
| \<20         | 2\*             |
| \<35         | 3\*             |
| 40           | 4               |

## Payment Guidelines

To get paid, you **MUST** get 3 hours worth of shift time.

The minimum quota is 2 hours, but to get paid you will have to achieve 3 hours worth of shift time.

You can only go on 50/50 for half of the required 3 hours to get paid; the rest of the required 3 hours will have to be done on normal duty (sheriff team).

If you are going on duty you **must** click your shift type, failure to do so will result as it not being counted.
